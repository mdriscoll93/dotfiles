- **Atlassian Git Tutorial on Dotfiles**: The method used to manage these dotfiles is based on the approach outlined in the [Atlassian Git Tutorial on Dotfiles](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles). This guide offers a comprehensive explanation of using a bare Git repository to track dotfiles without cluttering your `$HOME` directory with Git metadata.
